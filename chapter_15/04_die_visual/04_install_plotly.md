Description: 

  "Plotly Express depends on *pandas*, which is a library for working efficiently 
  with data, so we need to install that as well. If you used **python3** or 
  something else when installing Matplotlib, make sure you use the same 
  command here.
  
  To see what kind of visualization are possible with Plotly, visit the gallery 
  of chart types at [plotly.com/python](https://plotly.com/python). Each example 
  includes source code, so you can see how Plotly generates visualizations."

* Install Plotly using pip, just as you did for Matplotlib:

      python -m pip install --user plotly
      python -m pip install --user pandas
