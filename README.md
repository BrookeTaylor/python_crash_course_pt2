Description: 

  "The Data Visualization projects start in **Chapter 15**, where you'll learn to generate data and create a series of functional and beautiful visualizations of that data using Matplotlib and Plotly. **Chapter 16** teaches you to access data from online sources and feed it into a visualization package to create plots of weather data and a map of global earthquake activity. Finally, **Chapter 17** shows you how to write a program to automatically download and visualize data. Learning to make visualizations allows you to explore the field of data science, which is one of the highest-demand areas of programming today."
